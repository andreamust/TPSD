# Re-implementation of TPSD

This repository contains a Python 3 re-implementation of the Tonal Pitch Space Distance as described in:

---
De Haas, W.B., Veltkamp, R.C., Wiering, F.: Tonal pitch step distance: a similarity measure for chord progressions. In: ISMIR. pp. 51â€“56 (2008)

The implementation contained in this repository has nothing to do with the authors of the above-mentioned paper and has
to be intended an interpretation of their work.
